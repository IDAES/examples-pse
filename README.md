# IDAES Examples

This Git repository contains the example notebooks and scripts for
the IDAES-PSE code. Some examples are Jupyter Notebooks, and
some are Python scripts.

The examples can be viewed online at 
[this page](https://IDAES.github.io/examples-pse).

*If you are a developer who wants to add a new example to this repository,
please refer to the [README-developer.md](README-developer.md)
in this directory for instructions.*

## Install

First, you need to download and install the examples locally, on your own computer.
Instructions for doing this are in the
[install instructions](https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/getting_started/index.html#generic-install)
in the main IDAES-PSE toolkit documentation -- under the "Generic install"
section. That page also contains a link to more detailed help on the
options for choosing a custom installation directory.

## Run

Once you have installed the examples you will find in the download
directory a number of Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks that you
can run.

### Running Python scripts

To run the Python scripts, navigate to the directory in which they
are held and either use a command or graphical Python interface (see this 
[README-developer](README-developer.md)).

### Running Jupyter Notebooks

Many of the examples are [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org).
To help navigate them, there is an index with short descriptions
at the top-level in a notebook "notebook_index.ipynb". To use this, run:

	jupyter notebook notebook_index.ipynb

or open the file from the desktop with the Jupyter program by double-clicking.

You can also, of course, browse to specific notebooks and open them directly, in the same manner described above.
