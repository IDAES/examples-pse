# IDAES Examples

This repository contains the example notebooks and scripts for
the IDAES-PSE code. Some examples are Jupyter Notebooks, and
some are Python scripts.

The examples can be viewed online at 
[this page](https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples).

## Installation

To run the examples, you will need to install them locally.

### Install Python

The first step is to install Python. Although some version of Python
probably came with your system, in the long run it will be easier for
most people to install the 
[Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/), that
includes Jupyter Lab and Jupyter Notebook, as well as a number of 
useful graphical interfaces.

### Install IDAES

This requires that you install the 
IDAES Process Systems Engineering (IDAES-PSE) toolkit.
IDAES-PSE is in a 
[public repository on Github](https://github.com/idaes/idaes-pse)
Full installation instructions are available on the
[install page](https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/index.html) 
of the online documentation.

### Install the examples

For most people, the easiest way to install these examples is to use the 
[idaes install-examples](https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install-examples.html)
command that is part of the IDAES-PSE toolkit. This will download 
and install the examples, and their documentation, in the local system.
From there, you can browse the directory you chose to install them
in and run the scripts or Jupyter Notebooks (see next section if you
need help with this).

Some people, though, may want to work directly with the examples repository
on Github, which is at [https://github.com/IDAES/examples-pse](https://github.com/IDAES/examples-pse). 
This is more DIY, but it will give you more control of what gets installed, and also
be easier to transition to being a developer (adding your own code). 


## Running the examples

Once you have installed the examples, and IDAES-PSE, you can run
either the Python scripts or Jupyter Notebooks.
To run the Python scripts, navigate to the directory in which they
are held and either use a command or graphical Python interface (see this 
[page on how to run Python on Windows](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/windows.html)).
