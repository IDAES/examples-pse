Bimetallic Nanocluster Cohesive Energy Minimization - via Labeling
==================================================================

This notebook serves as an example application of the MatOpt framework.
We consider an example optimization problem of identifying the global
energy minimum bimetallic nanocluster configuration.

This is a continuation of the example given in
***Monometallic_Nanocluster_Design.ipynb***. In this example, we will
show how a very similar model can be used to optimize a bimetallic
cluster by “labelling” the sites of a pre-defined monometallic cluster.

For more information, see: Yin, X., et al. “Designing Stable Bimetallic
Nanoclusters via an Iterative Two-Step Optimization Approach.”

Publication.

Importing Packages
------------------

We start by importing several standard Python modules for convienience.

.. code:: ipython3

    import numpy as np
    from math import sqrt

Then, we import the MatOpt package in its entirety.

.. code:: ipython3

    from idaes.apps.matopt import *

Setting Up a Material System
----------------------------

We first identify the optimal metal-independent nanocluster shape, using
the code that wsas demonstrated in
**Monometallic_Nanocluster_Design.ipynb**.

.. code:: ipython3

    Lat = FCCLattice(IAD=1.0)
    Canv = Canvas()
    Canv.addLocation(np.array([0,0,0],dtype=float))
    Canv.addShells(1,Lat.getNeighbors)
    Atoms = [Atom('Cu')]
    N = 6
    m = MatOptModel(Canv,Atoms)
    Vals = [sqrt(CN) for CN in range(0,13)]
    BPs = [CN for CN in range(0,13)]
    m.addSitesDescriptor('CNRi',bounds=(0,sqrt(12)),integer=False,
                         rules=PiecewiseLinear(values=Vals,
                                               breakpoints=BPs,
                                               input_desc=m.Ci))
    m.addGlobalDescriptor('Ecoh',rules=EqualTo(SumSites(desc=m.CNRi,
                                                        coefs=(1/(N*sqrt(12))))))
    m.addGlobalDescriptor('Size',bounds=(N,N),
                          rules=EqualTo(SumSites(desc=m.Yi)))

.. code:: ipython3

    # This step requires the CPLEX solver
    try:
        D = m.maximize(m.Ecoh,tilim=100)
    except Exception as err:
        D = None  # rest of this notebook won't do much

We take the locations from the optimal monometallic problem to
initialize a ***Canvas*** object for the bimetallic case.

.. code:: ipython3

    Canv = Canvas()
    if D:  # may be None if CPLEX was not found
        for i in range(len(D)):
            if(D.Contents[i] is not None):
                Canv.addLocation(D.Canvas.Points[i])
    Canv.setNeighborsFromFunc(Lat.getNeighbors)

Additionally, we create a few data structures for holding bimetallic
material information. First, we make a list of multiple ***Atom***
objects that will be the building blocks of the model. Next, we specify
a dictionary with the bounds to impose on composition.

.. code:: ipython3

    Atoms = [Atom('Cu'),Atom('Ag')]
    CompBounds = {Atom('Cu'):(3,3),
                  Atom('Ag'):(3,3)}

Specifying an Optimization Model
--------------------------------

We start by creating a ***MatOptModel*** object that will hold the
information about the problem variables and constraints. At a minimum,
ever model requires a Canvas object to be defined. Additionally, the
list of building blocks and conformations that are present in the model
should be defined.

.. code:: ipython3

    m = MatOptModel(Canv,Atoms)

By default, several basic variables are pre-defined. See the first
example, ***Monometallic_Nanocluster_Design.ipynb*** for a description
of basic variables, expressions, and constraint rules.

To start, we inidcate that the choice to place an atom is fixed so that
each canvas site is required to have an atom. This simplifies the
problem significantly and results in a model that will seek to find the
optimal labeling of metals on the nanocluster.

.. code:: ipython3

    m.Yi.rules.append(FixedTo(1.0))

Next, we define a descriptor for the energy of bonds as a function of
properties at each site. Since the locations of the atoms are fixed, the
only decision is how to label each site as either Atom A or Atom B. This
allows us to simplify the model and compute coefficients that rely on
coordination number. In the block below, we implement the bimetallic
model for bond energy defined in Yan et al., 2018.

.. code:: ipython3

    GklCoefs = {(Atom('Cu'),Atom('Cu')):3.520,
                (Atom('Cu'),Atom('Ag')):2.112,
                (Atom('Ag'),Atom('Ag')):2.580,
                (Atom('Ag'),Atom('Cu')):3.612}
    BEijCoefs = {}
    for i in range(len(Canv)):
        CNi = sum(1 for _ in Canv.NeighborhoodIndexes[i] if _ is not None)
        for j in Canv.NeighborhoodIndexes[i]:
            if(j is not None):
                CNj = sum(1 for _ in Canv.NeighborhoodIndexes[j] if _ is not None)
                for k in Atoms:
                    for l in Atoms:
                        BEijCoefs[i,j,k,l] = GklCoefs[k,l]*1/sqrt(CNi) + GklCoefs[l,k]*1/sqrt(CNj)
    m.addBondsDescriptor('BEij',
                         rules=EqualTo(SumBondTypes(m.Xijkl,coefs=BEijCoefs)),
                         symmetric_bonds=True)

Next, we define the cohesive energy as a sum of contributions from all
BEij bond descriptors.

.. code:: ipython3

    m.addGlobalDescriptor('Ecoh',rules=EqualTo(SumBonds(desc=m.BEij,
                                                        coefs=1/(N*sqrt(12)))))

Finally, we add constraints on the size and composition of the resulting
designs.

.. code:: ipython3

    m.addGlobalTypesDescriptor('Composition',bounds=CompBounds,
                               rules=EqualTo(SumSites(desc=m.Yik)))

Solving the Model
-----------------

Once the model is fully specified, we can optimize in light of a global
descriptor. In this example, we choose to maximize the cohesive energy
defined previously. Additionally, we can specify basic optimization
parameters such as the time limit and memory limit\* for the optimizer.

.. code:: ipython3

    D = None
    try:
        D = m.maximize(m.Ecoh,tilim=360,trelim=4096)
    except:
        print('MaOpt can not find usable solver (CPLEX or NEOS-CPLEX)')

If a design was identified (optimal or otherwise), then a ***Design***
object is returned from the optimization method. The optimal design can
be plotted via any of the supported parsers.
