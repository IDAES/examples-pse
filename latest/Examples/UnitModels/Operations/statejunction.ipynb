    "\n",
    "In this example, we will be passing a mixed benzene-toluene stream and a mixed H2O-NaOH stream through a StateJunction. The IDAES StateJunction is a pass-through block or simple pipe that is primarily used to link streams to/from different process alternatives in conceptual design applications. The inlet conditions are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Molar Flow Rate = 100 mol/s\n",
    "\n",
    "Temperature = 298.15 K\n",
    "\n",
    "Pressure = 101325 Pa\n",
    "\n",
    "Mole Fraction (benzene) = 0.6\n",
    "\n",
    "Mole Fraction (toluene) = 0.4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case 2**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* Case 1: Use the StateJunction to solve a problem with constraints (requires a flowsheet-level solver).\n",
