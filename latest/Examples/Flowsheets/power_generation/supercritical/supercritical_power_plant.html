<section id="introduction">
<h2>1. Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>This example is to demonstrate a supercritical pulverized coal power
plant model. The power plant consists of two major sub-systems (or
flowsheets), a boiler heat exchanger network and a steam cycle. This
jupyter notebook provides the workflow to import the steam cycle
flowsheet, import the boiler heat exchanger network, connect and run
both the flowsheets, and display the main results.</p>
</section>
<section id="model-description">
<h2>2. Model Description<a class="headerlink" href="#model-description" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The case study demonstrated here is for a ~620MW gross power output. The
process flow diagram is shown in section 3 of this jupyter notebook.
Figure 1 shows the boiler heat exchanger network, while, figure 2 shows
the steam cycle system.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The streams connecting both the flowsheets are:</div>
<div class="line">  a) The main steam: that connects the boiler attemperator to the
throttle valves of the high pressure turbine   b) The cold reheat:
that connects the final stage of the high pressure turbine to the
boiler reheater</div>
<div class="line">  c) The hot reheat: that connects the boiler reheater to the
intermediate pressure turbine</div>
<div class="line">  d) The main feed water: that connects the last feed water heater to
the boiler economizer</div>
</div>
<p>To get a more detailed description of the power plant flowsheet, review
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SCPC_full_plant.py</span></code> file. For details in terms of specific power
plant units (for example dimensions, parameters, and variables), more
information can be found at <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">supercritical_steam_cycle.py</span></code> and
