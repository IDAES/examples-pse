Tutorial: Feed Flash Unit Model with Modular Property Package
=============================================================

.. image:: feed.svg

Learning Outcomes
-----------------

-  Demonstrate use of the Feed Flash unit model in IDAES
-  Demonstrate different options available

Problem Statement
-----------------

In this tutorial, we will be feeding vapor-liquid streams into the feed
flash unit model using two different sets of state variables. Like the
traditional feed block, the feed flash unit model has no inlets and only
one outlet, so the stream information is fed to the model through a feed
port rather than an inlet. The feed conditions are as follows:

**Case 1**

Flow Rate = 100 mol/s

Mole Fraction (Benzene) = 0.6

Mole Fraction (Toluene) = 0.4

Temperature = 298 K

Pressure = 101325 Pa

**Case 2**

Flow Rate = 100 mol/s

Enthalpy = 24000 J/mol

Pressure = 101325 Pa

Like the feed block, feed flash blocks are used to represent sources of
material in the flowsheet. However, this unit model also supports phase
equilibrium, so it should be used when the feed stream may be in a
multi-phase state and the chosen property package has a state definition
that includes phase separations. Phase equilibrium is determined by
assuming isobaric and isothermal flash operation. More information on
the feed flash model can be found here:
https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference_guides/model_libraries/generic/unit_models/feed_flash.html

For more details, please refer to the IDAES documentation:
https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/stable

Importing necessary tools
-------------------------

In the following cell, we will be importing the necessary components
from Pyomo and IDAES.

.. code:: ipython3

    # Import objects from pyomo package 
    from pyomo.environ import ConcreteModel, value
    
    # Import the solver
    from idaes.core.solvers import get_solver
    
    # Import the main FlowsheetBlock from IDAES. The flowsheet block will contain the unit model
    from idaes.core import FlowsheetBlock
    
    # Import the feed unit model and the option to set the flash type
    from idaes.models.unit_models.feed_flash import FeedFlash, FlashType
    
    # Import idaes logger to set output levels
    import idaes.logger as idaeslog
    
    # Import the modular property package to create a property block for the case 1 flowsheet
    from idaes.models.properties.modular_properties.base.generic_property import GenericParameterBlock
    
    # Import the BT_Ideal property package to create a configuration file for the GenericParameterBlock
    from idaes.models.properties.modular_properties.examples.BT_ideal import configuration
    
    # Import the IAPWS property package to create a property block for the case 2 flowsheet
    from idaes.models.properties import iapws95
    
    # Import the degrees_of_freedom function from the idaes.core.util.model_statistics package
    # DOF = Number of Model Variables - Number of Model Constraints
    from idaes.core.util.model_statistics import degrees_of_freedom

Setting up the flowsheet
------------------------

In the following cell, we will create the ``ConcreteModel`` foundation,
attach the steady state flowsheet, and declare the property parameter
block that will used for each of the cases.

More information on this general workflow can be found here:
https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/how_to_guides/workflow/general.html

.. code:: ipython3

    m = ConcreteModel()
    
    m.fs = FlowsheetBlock(dynamic=False) # dynamic or ss flowsheet needs to be specified here
    
    m.fs.properties_1 = GenericParameterBlock(**configuration) # Case 1
    
    m.fs.properties_2 = iapws95.Iapws95ParameterBlock(phase_presentation=iapws95.PhaseType.LG) # Case 2 - set phases to liquid & gas

Case 1:
-------

In the following cell, we will be creating the feed flash unit model,
assigning a property package to it, and determining the initial degrees
of freedom associated with the feed unit model.

.. code:: ipython3

    m.fs.feed_1 = FeedFlash(property_package=m.fs.properties_1)
    
    DOF_initial = degrees_of_freedom(m)
    print('The initial degrees of freedom are: {0}'.format(DOF_initial))


.. parsed-literal::

    The initial degrees of freedom are: 5


Fixing input specifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following cell, we will be specifying the conditions for the feed
flash block in case 1 using a feed port and re-evaluating the degrees of
freedom to ensure the problem is square (i.e. DOF=0). While most other
unit models simply use the inlet port to fix the unit model’s operating
conditions, the feed flash unit model cannot because there is no inlet
stream to the feed block.

.. code:: ipython3

    m.fs.feed_1.flow_mol.fix(100) # converting to mol/s as unit basis is mol/s
    m.fs.feed_1.mole_frac_comp[0, "benzene"].fix(0.6)
    m.fs.feed_1.mole_frac_comp[0, "toluene"].fix(0.4)
    m.fs.feed_1.pressure.fix(101325) # Pa
    m.fs.feed_1.temperature.fix(298) # K
    
    DOF_final = degrees_of_freedom(m)
    print('The final degrees of freedom is: {0}'.format(DOF_final))


.. parsed-literal::

    The final degrees of freedom is: 0


Flowsheet Initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

IDAES includes pre-written initialization routines for all unit models.
Failing to initialize or having a poor intialization of a flowsheet may
result in the problem being unsolvable. The output from initialization
can be set to 7 different levels depending on the details required by
the user. In general, when a particular output level is set, any
information at that level and above gets picked up by logger. The
default level taken by the logger is INFO.

More information on these levels can be found in the IDAES
documentation:
https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference_guides/logging.html

.. code:: ipython3

    m.fs.feed_1.initialize(outlvl=idaeslog.WARNING)

Obtaining Simulation Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following cell, the flowsheet will be solved using the IDAES
``get_solver`` tool. Setting ``tee=True`` will display the solver
output.

.. code:: ipython3

    solver = get_solver()
    result = solver.solve(m, tee=True)
