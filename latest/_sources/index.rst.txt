IDAES Tutorials and Examples
============================

The `IDAES <https://www.idaes.org>`_ integrated platform (IDAES-IP) ships with a number of examples
cotained in Jupyter notebooks which can be run on
the user's own computer. This page provides links to
pre-generated forms of these examples. For instructions on downloading and running them on your own computer,
see the `IDAES-IP main documentation page <https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/>`_.

Although all the files are examples in the broad sense, the distinction here between "Examples" and "Tutorials"
is the amount of didactic content. In particular, Jupyter notebooks in the "Tutorials" section contain explicit
exercise and solution cells (a `cell` is a section of code or text in a Jupyter notebook),
whereas the "Examples" notebooks do not. When you download these examples to your
own computer, for the tutorial notebooks you can choose to run the version that has only the exercises and no
solutions.
