IDAES Tutorials
===============

The tutorials linked below are Jupyter Notebooks, which create and run IDAES models.
They provide a thorough introduction to the capabilities
of the IDAES PSE framework. They were originally presented at an IDAES stakeholder meeting
in May of 2019. Each tutorial presents the creation of models, etc., as a series
of steps with extensive context and information. Each tutorial builds on information
from the prior one, so it is recommended that the new user view them in order.
