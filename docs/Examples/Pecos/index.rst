Pecos
======
Pecos is an open-source Python package designed to monitor performance of time series data, subject to a series of quality control tests. 
The software includes methods to run quality control tests and generate reports which include test results and graphics. 
Results from the quality control analysis can be used to extract "clean data" which removes data points that failed quality control inspection.
The software can be customized for specific applications.  More information on Pecos can be found at https://pecos.readthedocs.io.

A simple quality control example using a small data set is included below.
An additional example using plant data will be added at a later date.
