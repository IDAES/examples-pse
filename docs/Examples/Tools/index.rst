The IDAES Data Management Framework (DMF) is used to manage all the data needed by the IDAES framework, including flowsheets, models, and results. It stores metadata and data in persistent storage. More information can be found in the `DMF documentation <https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/components/dmf/dmf-overview.html>`_.

Degeneracy Hunter is a collection of tools for nonlinear optimization modeling diagnostics. The main algorithm to compute irreducible degenerate sets is described in `a conference paper <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780444635785501304>`_.
