# About this directory
This directory is for running quick tests of the build.py
script, without any of the IDAES machinery.

## Running
To run tests, change to this directory and run build.py
commands, such as: 

`python ..\..\build.py  -C .\build.yml -cd`

That will execute and build documentation for the
sample notebooks. Note that the 'bad' notebooks are
expected to fail.

You could also run in 'test' mode with something like:

`python ..\..\build.py  -C .\build.yml -rt -w 4 -v`
