    title: Introduction
    text: >-2
      The [IDAES](https://www.idaes.org) integrated platform ships with a number of examples which can be run on
      the user's own computer.
      This page provides links to these examples and provides some guidance in the order in which to try them.


      The IDAES examples are contained in Jupyter Notebooks. In order to view and
      use this content, you need to open the files with the Jupyter notebook executable
      (which may be configured on your system as the default application for files of this
      type). To get started with Jupyter, please
      see the [Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org) or jump directly to the
      [official Jupyter Notebook documentation pages](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

      In addition to viewing and running the examples interactively on your own computer, you can see fully rendered,
      static versions of the examples in the online
      [examples documentation](https://IDAES.github.io/examples-pse/) pages. For reference documentation
      on the IDAES integrated platform, please see the online
      [IDAES-PSE documentation](https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).

    title: Usage
    text: >-2
      The example notebooks contained in this folder are divided into two sub-types, each with their own folder:
        * `Tutorials`: Notebooks that are written as tutorials complete with guided exercises
        * `Examples`: Notebooks that do not have tutorial content.

      Below is an ordering of both types of examples
      to help progressively learn how to use the IDAES integrated platform (IDAES-IP). Successive sections give
      more details on each of these example sections.

      * Beginner
        * Start with the tutorials under [Tutorials/Basics](#tutorials.basics)
        * Run the examples under [Examples/Basics](#examples.basics)
      * Intermediate
        * Run some selected examples under [Tutorials/UnitModels](#tutorials.unitmodels)
        * Also run at least one tutorial in [Tutorials/Advanced/Custom unit models](#tutorials.advanced.customunit) and
          [Tutorials/Advanced/Custom property packages](#tutorials.advanced.customproperties)
        * `At this point you should stop and try some of your own code`
      * Advanced
        * Run tutorials in [Tutorials/Advanced](#tutorials.advanced) for other topics of interest
          * [Parameter estimation](#tutorials.advanced.paramest)
          * [Surrogate models](#tutorials.advanced.surrmod)
          * [Materials optimization](#tutorials.advanced.matopt)
        * Also run examples in the [Examples/Advanced](#examples.advanced) section

      All the notebooks in this folder have three different files
      that represent different variations on the same content. The suffix of the filename indicates
      something about the variation contained in that file. For example, if the notebook is named "a_notebook", then
      you would expect the following files:
        * `a_notebook_exercise.ipynb`: Main notebook. *This is the one most users should run.*
        * `a_notebook_solution.ipynb`: Notebook with solutions to the exercises included
        * `a_notebook_solution_testing.ipynb`: Notebook with additional cells to test the correctness of the solution.
          This file does not normally need to be opened by users.


      For ease of reading, we will indicate notebooks by their name before the suffixes. For example, if you see
      "Introduction" as the notebook name, then you should open the file `Introduction_exercise.ipynb`.
      Links to the exercise and exercise + solution files will be provided for each notebook.
