Flash Unit Model
================

In this module, we will familiarize ourselves with the IDAES framework
by creating and working with a flowsheet that contains a single flash
tank. The flash tank will be used to perform separation of Benzene and
Toluene. The inlet specifications for this flash tank are:

Inlet Specifications: \* Mole fraction (Benzene) = 0.5 \* Mole fraction
(Toluene) = 0.5 \* Pressure = 101325 Pa \* Temperature = 368 K

We will complete the following tasks: \* Create the model and the IDAES
Flowsheet object \* Import the appropriate property packages \* Create
the flash unit and set the operating conditions \* Initialize the model
and simulate the system \* Demonstrate analyses on this model through
some examples and exercises

Create the Model and the IDAES Flowsheet
----------------------------------------

In the next cell, we will perform the necessary imports to get us
started. From ``pyomo.environ`` (a standard import for the Pyomo
package), we are importing ``ConcreteModel`` (to create the Pyomo model
that will contain the IDAES flowsheet) and ``SolverFactory`` (to create
the object we will use to solve the equations). We will also import
``Constraint`` as we will be adding a constraint to the model later in
the module. Lastly, we also import ``value`` from Pyomo. This is a
function that can be used to return the current numerical value for
variables and parameters in the model. These are all part of Pyomo.

We will also import the main ``FlowsheetBlock`` from IDAES. The
flowsheet block will contain our unit model.

Define Properties
-----------------

We need to define the property package for our flowsheet. In this
example, we will be using the ideal property package that is available
as part of the IDAES framework. This property package supports ideal gas
- ideal liquid, ideal gas - NRTL, and ideal gas - Wilson models for VLE.
More details on this property package can be found at:
https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/model_libraries/core_library/property_models/activity_coefficient.html

IDAES also supports creation of your own property packages that allow
for specification of the fluid using any set of valid state variables
(e.g., component molar flows vs overall flow and mole fractions). This
flexibility is designed to support advanced modeling needs that may rely
on specific formulations. To learn about creating your own property
package, please consult the online documentation at:
https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core/properties.html and look
at examples within IDAES

For this workshop, we will import the BTX_activity_coeff_VLE property
parameter block to be used in the flowsheet. This properties block will
be passed to our unit model to define the appropriate state variables
and equations for performing thermodynamic calculations.

.. raw:: html

   <div class="alert alert-block alert-info">

Inline Exercise: Execute the following two cells to import and create
the properties block.

.. raw:: html

   </div>

.. code:: ipython3

    from idaes.generic_models.properties.activity_coeff_models.BTX_activity_coeff_VLE \
        import BTXParameterBlock

.. code:: ipython3

    m.fs.properties = BTXParameterBlock(default={"valid_phase": ('Liq', 'Vap'),
                                                "activity_coeff_model": "Ideal",
                                                "state_vars": "FTPz"})

Adding Flash Unit
-----------------

Now that we have the flowsheet and the properties defined, we can create
the flash unit and add it to the flowsheet.

**The Unit Model Library within IDAES includes a large set of common
unit operations (see the online documentation for details:
https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/model_libraries/core_library/unit_models/index.html**

IDAES also fully supports the development of customized unit models
(which we will see in a later module).

Some of the IDAES pre-written unit models: \* Mixer / Splitter \* Heater
/ Cooler \* Heat Exchangers (simple and 1D discretized) \* Flash \*
Reactors (kinetic, equilibrium, gibbs, stoichiometric conversion) \*
Pressure changing equipment (compressors, expanders, pumps) \* Feed and
Product (source / sink) components

In this module, we will import the ``Flash`` unit model from
``idaes.generic_models.unit_models`` and create an instance of the flash
unit, attaching it to the flowsheet. Each IDAES unit model has several
configurable options to customize the model behavior, but also includes
defaults for these options. In this example, we will specify that the
property package to be used with the Flash is the one we created
earlier.

.. raw:: html

   <div class="alert alert-block alert-info">

Inline Exercise: Execute the following two cells to import the Flash and
create an instance of the unit model, attaching it to the flowsheet
object.

.. raw:: html

   </div>

.. code:: ipython3

    from idaes.generic_models.unit_models import Flash

.. code:: ipython3

    m.fs.flash = Flash(default={"property_package": m.fs.properties})

At this point, we have created a flowsheet and a properties block. We
have also created a flash unit and added it to the flowsheet. Under the
hood, IDAES has created the required state variables and model
equations. Everything is open. You can see these variables and equations
by calling the Pyomo method ``pprint`` on the model, flowsheet, or flash
tank objects. Note that this output is very exhaustive, and is not
intended to provide any summary information about the model, but rather
a complete picture of all of the variables and equations in the model.

Set Operating Conditions
------------------------

Now that we have created our unit model, we can specify the necessary
operating conditions. It is often very useful to determine the degrees
of freedom before we specify any conditions.

The ``idaes.core.util.model_statistics`` package has a function
``degrees_of_freedom``. To see how to use this function, we can make use
of the Python function ``help(func)``. This function prints the
appropriate documentation string for the function.

.. raw:: html

   <div class="alert alert-block alert-info">

Inline Exercise: Import the degrees_of_freedom function and print the
help for the function by calling the Python help function.

.. raw:: html

   </div>

.. code:: ipython3

    # Todo: import the degrees_of_freedom function from the idaes.core.util.model_statistics package
    from idaes.core.util.model_statistics import degrees_of_freedom
    
    # Todo: Call the python help on the degrees_of_freedom function
    help(degrees_of_freedom)


.. parsed-literal::

    Help on function degrees_of_freedom in module idaes.core.util.model_statistics:
    
    degrees_of_freedom(block)
        Method to return the degrees of freedom of a model.
        
        Args:
            block : model to be studied
        
        Returns:
            Number of degrees of freedom in block.
    


.. raw:: html

   <div class="alert alert-block alert-info">

Inline Exercise: Now print the degrees of freedom for your model. The
result should be 7.

.. raw:: html

   </div>

.. code:: ipython3

    # Todo: print the degrees of freedom for your model
    print("Degrees of Freedom =", degrees_of_freedom(m))


.. parsed-literal::

    Degrees of Freedom = 7


To satisfy our degrees of freedom, we will first specify the inlet
conditions. We can specify these values through the ``inlet`` port of
the flash unit.

**To see the list of naming conventions for variables within the IDAES
framework, consult the online documentation at:
https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/standards.html#standard-naming-format**

As an example, to fix the molar flow of the inlet to be 1.0, you can use
the following notation:

.. code:: python

    m.fs.flash.inlet.flow_mol.fix(1.0)

To specify variables that are indexed by components, you can use the
following notation:

.. code:: python

    m.fs.flash.inlet.mole_frac_comp[0, "benzene"].fix(0.5)

.. raw:: html

   <div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">

Note: The “0” in the indexing of the component mole fraction is present
because IDAES models support both dynamic and steady state simulation,
and the “0” refers to a timestep. Dynamic modeling is beyond the scope
of this workshop. Since we are performing steady state modeling, there
is only a single timestep in the model.

.. raw:: html

   </div>

In the next cell, we will specify the inlet conditions. To satisfy the
remaining degrees of freedom, we will make two additional specifications
on the flash tank itself. The names of the key variables within the
Flash unit model can also be found in the online documentation:
https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/model_libraries/core_library/unit_models/flash.html#variables.

To specify the value of a variable on the unit itself, use the following
notation.

.. code:: python

    m.fs.flash.heat_duty.fix(0)

For this module, we will use the following specifications: \* inlet
overall molar flow = 1.0 (``flow_mol``) \* inlet temperature = 368 K
(``temperature``) \* inlet pressure = 101325 Pa (``pressure``) \* inlet
mole fraction (benzene) = 0.5 (``mole_frac_comp[0, "benzene"]``) \*
inlet mole fraction (toluene) = 0.5 (``mole_frac_comp[0, "toluene"]``)
\* The heat duty on the flash set to 0 (``heat_duty``) \* The pressure
drop across the flash tank set to 0 (``deltaP``)

.. raw:: html

   <div class="alert alert-block alert-info">

Inline Exercise: Write the code below to specify the inlet conditions
and unit specifications described above

Initializing the Model
----------------------

IDAES includes pre-written initialization routines for all unit models.
You can call this initialize method on the units. In the next module, we
will demonstrate the use of a sequential modular solve cycle to
initialize flowsheets.

Viewing the Results
-------------------

Once a model is solved, the values returned by the solver are loaded
into the model object itself. We can access the value of any variable in
the model with the ``value`` function. For example:

.. code:: python

    print('Vap. Outlet Temperature = ', value(m.fs.flash.vap_outlet.temperature[0]))

You can also find more information about a variable or an entire port
using the ``display`` method from Pyomo:

.. code:: python

    m.fs.flash.vap_outlet.temperature.display()
    m.fs.flash.vap_outlet.display()

.. raw:: html

   <div class="alert alert-block alert-info">

Inline Exercise: Execute the cells below to show the current value of
the flash vapor outlet pressure. This cell also shows use of the display
function to see the values of the variables in the vap_outlet and the
liq_outlet.

.. raw:: html

   </div>

.. code:: ipython3

    # Print the pressure of the flash vapor outlet
    print('Pressure =', value(m.fs.flash.vap_outlet.pressure[0]))
    
    print()
    print('Output from display:')
    # Call display on vap_outlet and liq_outlet of the flash
    m.fs.flash.vap_outlet.display()
    m.fs.flash.liq_outlet.display()


.. parsed-literal::

    Pressure = 101325.0

The output from ``display`` is quite exhaustive and not really intended
to provide quick summary information. Because Pyomo is built on Python,
there are opportunities to format the output any way we like. Most IDAES
models have a ``report`` method which provides a summary of the results
for the model.

Studying Purity as a Function of Heat Duty
------------------------------------------

Since the entire modeling framework is built upon Python, it includes a
complete programming environment for whatever analysis we may want to
perform. In this next exercise, we will make use of what we learned in
this and the previous module to generate a figure showing some output
variables as a function of the heat duty in the flash tank.

First, let’s import the matplotlib package for plotting as we did in the
previous module.

appropriately.

-17000 to 25000 over 50 steps

Recall that the IDAES framework is an equation-oriented modeling
environment. This means that we can specify “design” problems natively.
That is, there is no need to have our specifications on the inlet alone.
We can put specifications on the outlet as long as we retain a
well-posed, square system of equations.

For example, we can remove the specification on heat duty and instead
specify that we want the mole fraction of Benzene in the vapor outlet to
be equal to 0.6. The mole fraction is not a native variable in the
property block, so we cannot use “fix”. We can, however, add a
constraint to the model.

Note that we have been executing a number of solves on the problem, and
may not be sure of the current state. To help convergence, therefore, we
will first call initialize, then add the new constraint and solve the
problem. Note that the reference for the mole fraction of Benzene in the
vapor outlet is ``m.fs.flash.vap_outlet.mole_frac_comp[0, "benzene"]``.
