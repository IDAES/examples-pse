<h1>Supercritical Steam Cycle Example<a class="headerlink" href="#supercritical-steam-cycle-example" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>This example uses Jupyter Lab or Jupyter notebook, and demonstrates a
supercritical pulverized coal (SCPC) steam cycle model. See the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">supercritical_steam_cycle.py</span></code> to see more information on how to
assemble a power plant model flowsheet. Code comments in that file will
guide you through the process.</p>
<section id="model-description">
<h2>Model Description<a class="headerlink" href="#model-description" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The example model doesn’t represent any particular power plant, but
should be a reasonable approximation of a typical plant. The gross power
output is about 620 MW. The process flow diagram (PFD) can be shown
using the code below. The initial PFD contains spaces for model results,
to be filled in later.</p>
<p>To get a more detailed look at the model structure, you may find it
useful to review <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">supercritical_steam_cycle.py</span></code> first. Although there
is no detailed boiler model, there are constraints in the model to
complete the steam loop through the boiler and calculate boiler heat
input to the steam cycle. The efficiency calculation for the steam cycle
doesn’t account for heat loss in the boiler, which would be a result of
a more detailed boiler model.</p>

<p>This example is part of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">idaes</span></code> package, which you should have
installed. To run the example, the example flowsheet is imported from
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">idaes</span></code> package. When you write your own model, you can import and
run it in whatever way is appropriate for you. The Pyomo environment is
also imported as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyo</span></code>, providing easy access to Pyomo functions and
classes.</p>
<p>The supercritical flowsheet example main function returns a Pyomo
concrete mode (m) and a solver object (solver). The model is also
initialized by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">main()</span></code> function.</p>

EXIT: Optimal Solution Found.</pre>
<p>Inside the model, there is a subblock <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fs</span></code>. This is an IDAES flowsheet
model, which contains the supercritical steam cycle model. In the
flowsheet, the model called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">turb</span></code> is a multistage turbine model. The
turbine model contains an expression for total power, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">power</span></code>. In this
case the model is steady-state, but all IDAES models allow for dynamic
simulation, and contain time indexes. Power is indexed by time, and only
the “0” time point exists. By convention, in the IDAES framework, power
going into a model is positive, so power produced by the turbine is
negative.</p>
<p>The property package used for this model uses SI (mks) units of measure,
so the power is in Watts. Here a function is defined which can be used
to report power output in MW.</p>

<p>The turbine in this example simulates partial arc admission with four
arcs, so there are four throttle valves. For this example, we will close
one of the valves to 25% open, and observe the result.</p>
