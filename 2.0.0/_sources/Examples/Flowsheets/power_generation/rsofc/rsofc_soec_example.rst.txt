1. Introduction
---------------

The figure above shows the process flow diagram of the rSOC (reversible
solid oxide cell) plant in SOEC (solid oxide electrolysis cell) mode.
The plant consists of five major sections: the ASU (air separation
unit), the SOEC power island, the CPU (CO2 purification unit), the HRSG
(heat recovery steam generator) and steam cycle.

In the SOEC mode, the rSOC operates by using steam as fuel to produce
Hydrogen on its fuel side (cathode side), while air is used as sweep gas
to remove diffused oxygen from its air side (anode side). To provide air
to the air side of the rSOC, ambient air is compressed in an air blower
and preheated via two preheaters to reach the required temperature to
sweep through the air side. The oxygen rich air stream which exits the
air side of the rSOC is used to preheat the fresh air feed in the first
air preheater, subsequently it is split in a splitter and used to
preheat oxygen from the ASU in the oxygen preheater and natural gas feed
in the natural gas preheater. Finally, the oxygen rich air streams from
both the oxygen and natural gas preheaters are sent to the HRSG where
they are further cooled before release to the atmosphere.

This flowsheet example provides an off-design model for the rSOC in SOEC
mode for hydrogen production up to **5 kg/s** with 98% CO2 capture.

2. Import Required Modules
--------------------------

-  **pyomo environment**. The pyomo environment
-  **rsofc_soec_flowsheet**. Contains functions for the work flow of
   building and solving the flowsheet. See the rsofc_soec_flowsheet.py
   file for more details.
-  **rsofc_costing**. Contains costing methods for the soec and sofc
   operating modes of the reversible sofc. See the rsofc_costing.py file
   for more details.

.. code:: ipython3

    import pyomo.environ as pyo
    import rsofc_soec_flowsheet as rsoec
    import rsofc_costing as rsofc_cost

3. Build and initialize the flowsheet
-------------------------------------

-  A pyomo concrete model is built
-  The **get_model** function in the **rsofc_soec_flowsheet.py** file
   takes the concrete model as an argument then sets up a flowsheet
   called **m.soec_fs**, and all the required unit models to it.
   Finally, the completed flowsheet is initialized. The concrete model
   and solver options are then returned.

.. code:: ipython3

    m = pyo.ConcreteModel()
    m, solver = rsoec.get_model(m)

4. Base case optimization example
---------------------------------

An example of optimizing the variable operating costs of the model at
its base case production of 5 kg/s using the **base_case_optimization**
function is shown below. The model also has functions to run a base case
simulation (**base_case_simulation**) and optimize the variable
operating cost of the process over the production range of 1 to 5 kg/s
(**optimize_model**)

.. code:: ipython3

    rsoec.tags_inputs_opt_vars(m.soec_fs)  # this function adds tags for the optimization variables
    rsofc_cost.get_rsofc_soec_variable_OM_costing(m.soec_fs)
    rsoec.base_case_optimization(m, solver)
