SOFC + SOEC Model
=================

This notebook contains a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) coupled with a
solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) system. Both components can be run
at partial load, between 200 - 680 MW for the SOFC and between 1 - 5
kg/s hydrogen production for the SOEC. The systems are coupled
physically and electrically. The SOFC anode exhaust can be supplied to
make steam for the SOEC or to power a bottoming steam cycle. Electricity
from the SOFC is used to power the SOEC and balance of plant. If there
is excess it can be supplied to the grid. The SOFC is modeled with
surrogate equations generated from the SOFC example flowsheet. The
surrogates contain one input, the SOFC direct current power. The
surrogates are used to calculate the SOFC anode exhaust flowrate,
temperature, and composition, the SOFC balance of plant load, and
natural gas use.

Module Imports
--------------

.. code:: ipython3

    import os
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    import pytest
    from IPython.core.display import SVG
    
    import pyomo.environ as pyo
    from pyomo.environ import units as pyunits
    from pyomo.util.infeasible import log_infeasible_constraints

    import idaes.core.util as iutil
    
    from sofc_with_soec import (

    )

Make Output Directories
-----------------------

This notebook can produce a large number of output files. To make it
easier to manage, some subdirectories are used to organize output. This
ensures that the directories exist.

.. code:: ipython3

    # Make a directory if it doesn't exist
    def make_directory(path):
        if not os.path.exists(path):
            os.mkdir(path)
        
    make_directory("data")
    make_directory("data_pfds")
    make_directory("data_tabulated")

Global Solver Settings
----------------------

Use the IDAES configuration system for solver settings. These will apply
to all Ipopt instances created, including the ones created in
initialization methods.

.. code:: ipython3

    use_idaes_solver_configuration_defaults()
    idaes.cfg.ipopt.options.nlp_scaling_method = "user-scaling"
    idaes.cfg.ipopt.options.linear_solver = "ma57"
    idaes.cfg.ipopt.options.OF_ma57_automatic_scaling = "yes"
    idaes.cfg.ipopt.options.ma57_pivtol = 1e-5
    idaes.cfg.ipopt.options.ma57_pivtolmax = 0.1
    idaes.cfg.ipopt.options.bound_push = 1e-20
    solver = pyo.SolverFactory("ipopt")

Create the SOFC + SOEC model
----------------------------

Create the SOFC + SOEC model and initialize it or read the saved
initialization if available.

.. code:: ipython3

    def get_base_sofc_soec_model(solve=True):
        m = get_model()
        save_name = "sofc_soec_init.json.gz"
        if os.path.exists(save_name):
            iutil.from_json(m, fname=save_name, wts=iutil.StoreSpec(suffix=False))
            print("Loading initialized model from json")
        else:
            initialize(m)
            iutil.to_json(m, fname=save_name)
        
        if solve:
            res = solver.solve(m, tee=True)
    
        return m

Run Partial Load
----------------

This runs the SOFC at partial load from 680 MW to 200 MW at 20 MW
intervals and the SOEC from 5 kg/s to 1 kg/s at 0.5 kg/s intervals.
Results are tabulated for tags in the tags_output tag group in a Pandas
data frame.

To run the series, change run_series to True. Running the turndown
series takes ~2 hours, unless previous saved results are available.
