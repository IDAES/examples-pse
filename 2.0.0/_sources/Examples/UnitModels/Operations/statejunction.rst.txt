Tutorial: StateJunction with Modular Property Package
=====================================================

.. image:: statejunction.svg

Learning Outcomes
-----------------

-  Demonstrate use of the StateJunction in IDAES
-  Demonstrate different options available

Problem Statement
-----------------

In this example, we will be passing a mixed benzene-toluene stream and a
mixed H2O-NaOH stream through a StateJunction. The IDAES StateJunction
is a pass-through block or simple pipe that is primarily used to link
streams to/from different process alternatives in conceptual design
applications. The inlet conditions are as follows:

**Case 1:**

Molar Flow Rate = 100 mol/s

Temperature = 298.15 K

Pressure = 101325 Pa

Mole Fraction (benzene) = 0.6

Mole Fraction (toluene) = 0.4

**Case 2**

Volumetric Flow Rate = 10 m^3/s

H2O Concentration = 5000 mol/m^3

NaOH Concentration = 25 mol/m^3

Temperature = 298.15 K

Pressure = 101325 Pa

We will look at two cases in this tutorial:

-  Case 1: Use the StateJunction to solve a problem with constraints
   (requires a flowsheet-level solver).

-  Case 2: Use the StateJunction to solve a problem without constraints
   (does not require a flowsheet-level solver).

For more details, please refer to the IDAES documentation:
https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/stable

Importing necessary tools
-------------------------

In the following cell, we will be importing the necessary components
from Pyomo and IDAES.

.. code:: ipython3

    # Import objects from pyomo package 
    from pyomo.environ import ConcreteModel, Constraint, value, SolverFactory
    
    # Import the solver
    from idaes.core.solvers import get_solver
    
    # Import the main FlowsheetBlock from IDAES. The flowsheet block will contain the unit model
    from idaes.core import FlowsheetBlock
    
    # Import the StateJunction block
    from idaes.models.unit_models import StateJunction
    
    # Import idaes logger to set output levels
    import idaes.logger as idaeslog
    
    # Import the modular property package to create a property block for the case 1 flowsheet
    from idaes.models.properties.modular_properties.base.generic_property import GenericParameterBlock
    
    # Import the BT_ideal property package to create a configuration file for the GenericParameterBlock based on the ideal eos
    from idaes.models.properties.modular_properties.examples.BT_ideal import configuration as configuration
    
    # Import the saponification property package to create a property block for the case 2 flowsheet
    from idaes.models.properties.examples.saponification_thermo import SaponificationParameterBlock
    
    # Import the degrees_of_freedom function from the idaes.core.util.model_statistics package
    # DOF = Number of Model Variables - Number of Model Constraints
    from idaes.core.util.model_statistics import degrees_of_freedom

Setting up the flowsheet
------------------------

In the following cell, we will create the ``ConcreteModel`` foundation,
attach the steady state flowsheet, and declare the property parameter
block that will used for each of the cases.

More information on this general workflow can be found here:
https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/how_to_guides/workflow/general.html

.. code:: ipython3

    m = ConcreteModel()
    
    m.fs = FlowsheetBlock(dynamic=False) # dynamic or ss flowsheet needs to be specified here
    
    m.fs.properties_1 = GenericParameterBlock(**configuration) # Case 1
    
    m.fs.properties_2 = SaponificationParameterBlock() # Case 2

Case 1:
-------

In the following cell, we will be creating the StateJunction block,
assigning the appropriate property package to it, and determining the
initial degrees of freedom associated with the StateJunction.

.. code:: ipython3

    m.fs.statejunction_1 = StateJunction(property_package=m.fs.properties_1)
    
    DOF_initial = degrees_of_freedom(m)
    print('The initial degrees of freedom is: {0}'.format(DOF_initial))


.. parsed-literal::

    The initial degrees of freedom is: 5


Fixing input specifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following cell, we will be specifying the inlet conditions for
the StateJunction block and re-evaluating the degrees of freedom to
ensure the problem is square (i.e. DOF=0).

.. code:: ipython3

    m.fs.statejunction_1.inlet.flow_mol.fix(100) # converting to mol/s as unit basis is mol/s
    m.fs.statejunction_1.inlet.mole_frac_comp[0, "benzene"].fix(0.6)
    m.fs.statejunction_1.inlet.mole_frac_comp[0, "toluene"].fix(0.4)
    m.fs.statejunction_1.inlet.pressure.fix(101325) # Pa
    m.fs.statejunction_1.inlet.temperature.fix(298.15) # K
    
    DOF_final = degrees_of_freedom(m)
    print('The final degrees of freedom is: {0}'.format(DOF_final))


.. parsed-literal::

    The final degrees of freedom is: 0


Flowsheet Initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

IDAES includes pre-written initialization routines for all unit models.
Failing to initialize or having a poor intialization of a flowsheet may
result in the problem being unsolvable. The output from initialization
can be set to 7 different levels depending on the details required by
the user. In general, when a particular output level is set, any
information at that level and above gets picked up by logger. The
default level taken by the logger is INFO.

More information on these levels can be found in the IDAES
documentation:
https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference_guides/logging.html

.. code:: ipython3

    m.fs.statejunction_1.initialize(outlvl=idaeslog.WARNING)

Obtaining Simulation Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following cell, the flowsheet will be solved using the IDAES
``get_solver`` tool. Setting ``tee=True`` will display the solver
output.

.. code:: ipython3

    solver = get_solver()
    result = solver.solve(m, tee=True)

Since this problem has no constraints, an additional solver is not
required to compute the properties of the outlet stream. As the

identical to that of the outlet.
