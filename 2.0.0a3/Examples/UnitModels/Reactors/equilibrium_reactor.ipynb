    "This example is adapted from S.Z. Abbas, V. Dupont, T. Mahmud, Kinetics study and modelling of steam methane reforming process over a NiO/Al2O3 catalyst in an adiabatic packed bed reactor. Int. J. Hydrogen Energy, 42 (2017), pp. 2889-2903\n",

    "Steam methane reforming (SMR) is one of the most common pathways for hydrogen production, taking advantage of chemical equilibria in natural gas systems. The process is typically done in two steps: methane reformation at a high temperature to partially oxidize methane, and water gas shift at a low temperature to complete the oxidation reaction:\n",

    "**CO + H<sub>2</sub>O → CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>**\n",
    "\n",
    "This reaction is often carried out in two separate reactors to allow for different reaction temperatures and pressures; in this example, we will minimize operating cost for a single reactor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flowsheet that we will be using for this module is shown below with the stream conditions. We will be processing natural gas and steam feeds of fixed composition to produce hydrogen. As shown in the flowsheet, the process consists of a mixer M101 for the two inlet streams, a compressor to compress the feed to the reaction pressure, a heater H101 to heat the feed to the reaction temperature, and a EquilibriumReactor unit R101. We will use thermodynamic properties from the Peng-Robinson equation of state for this flowsheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The state variables chosen for the property package are **total molar flows of each stream, temperature of each stream and pressure of each stream, and mole fractions of each component in each stream**. The components considered are: **CH<sub>4</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>** and the process occurs in vapor phase only. Therefore, every stream has 1 flow variable, 5 mole fraction variables, 1 temperature and 1 pressure variable. \n",

Therefore, we have 20 degrees of freedom to specify: temperature, pressure, flow and mole fractions of all five components on both streams; compressor pressure change and efficiency; outlet heater temperature; and reactor conversion.\n",

Each `StateBlock` sets a flag `defined_state` based on any remaining degrees of freedom; if this flag is set to `False` a `Constraint` is written to ensure all mole fractions sum to one. However, a fully specified system with `defined_state` set to `True` will not create this constraint and it is the responsibility of the user to set physically meaningful values, i.e. that all mole fractions are nonnegative and sum to one. While not necessary in this example, the [Custom Thermophysical Property Package Example](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/GitHub/examples-pse/src/Examples/Advanced/CustomProperties/custom_physical_property_packages_testing.ipynb) demonstrates adding a check before writing an additional constraint that may overspecify the system."

Suppose we wish to find ideal conditions for the competing reactions. As mentioned earlier, the two reactions have competing equilibria - steam methane reformation occurs more readily at higher temperatures (500-700 C) while water gas shift occurs more readily at lower temperatures (300-400 C). We will allow for variable reactor temperature and pressure by freeing our heater and compressor specifications, and minimize cost to achieve 90% methane conversion. Since we assume an isentopic compressor, allowing compression will heat our feed stream and reduce or eliminate the required heater duty."
