Data Reconciliation of a Supercritical Coal-Fired Boiler, Flowsheet Example
===========================================================================

This notebook demonstrates data reconciliation with a flowsheet heat
exchanger network, the boiler subflowsheet consist of an economizer,
water wall, primary superheater, platen superheater, finishing
superheater, and reheater. Data for this example was generated by adding
noise to supercritical power plant simulations.

Why reconcile data?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Data reconciliation uses mass and energy balances along with redundant
measurements to improve data quality by:

1. reducing measurement error,
2. ensuring measurements satisfy mass and energy balances, and
3. filling in unmeasured quantities.

Data reconciliation is used to refine process data before parameter
estimation.

1. Read Plant Data
------------------

The first step is to read in process data. In this case, data was
simulated by adding measurement error to supercritical steam cycle
simulation results. IDAES includes functions to read process data,
convert units to match the models, and map data to the model.

.. code:: ipython3

    # IDAES module with functions to read, analyze and visualize plant data
    import idaes.dmf.model_data as da

Process data is contained in two csv files, a data file and a metadata
file. The data file where the first column is row indexes and the first
row is process measurement tags. The index column has an entry for each
data row, and is often a timestamp. The metadata file contains
information about the tags including units of measurement, description,
and model mapping information.

Once the process data is read in, the data is assigned to bins based on
the value in a given column, in this case gross power. Dividing the data
into bins allows rough estimation of measurement uncertainty.

.. code:: ipython3

    # Read in data and column metadata
    df, df_meta = da.read_data("plant_data.csv", "plant_data_meta.csv")
    # Add bin information where the data is sorted into 5 MW bins based on the "GROSS_POWER" column
    bin_count = da.bin_data(df, bin_by="POWER_GROSS", bin_no="bin_no", bin_nom="bin_power", bin_size=5e6)
    # Calculate the standard deviation by bin for each column
    bin_stdev = da.bin_stdev(df, bin_no="bin_no")

It can be useful to visualize the measurement data and estimated
uncertainty. The following creates box and whisker plots for each tag
based on the data bins.

.. code:: ipython3

    # Create a pdf book of plots that shows box and whisker plots for each column by bin
    import os
    if not os.path.isfile("data_plot_book.pdf"):
        da.data_plot_book(df, file="data_plot_book.pdf", bin_nom="bin_power", xlabel="gross power (W)", metadata=df_meta)
    # There should now be a data_plot_book.pdf file in this directory

2. Boiler Flowsheet Setup
-------------------------

Now that we have the plant data, we need to create the flowsheet model
that we can use for data reconciliation. Although we need a model that
has just mass and energy balances and feasibility constraints for the
data reconciliation problem, we start with the boiler flowsheet model
here. Using the same model for data reconciliation, parameter
estimation, validation, and simulation reduces the work required to move
between steps in the workflow.

Once the full flowsheet model is created, constraints that are not
needed for data reconciliation can be deactivated.

2.1 Case Study:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a supercritical coal-fired power plant, the boiler sub-system
consists of multiple heat exchangers transferring heat from the
combustion side to the water/steam side. The boiler system for this work
(Figure 1) is based on a 550 MWe supercritical power plant. Note that
water wall and platen superheater are modeled as a heater, while the
rest of the units correspond to the shell and tube heat exchangers. Note
that boiler flowsheet block diagram shows the available measurements
from plant data. \*for demonstration purposes “plant data” has been
trained at different operating loads and with noise.

.. code:: ipython3

    # Import pyomo and idaes libraries
    # import idaes flowsheet object
    from idaes.core import FlowsheetBlock
    # import flue gas property package
    from idaes.power_generation.properties.IdealProp_FlueGas import FlueGasParameterBlock
    # import utility to report degrees of freedom
    from idaes.core.util.model_statistics import degrees_of_freedom
    # import water/steam property package and functions to calculate enthalpy
    from idaes.generic_models.properties import iapws95
    # import unit models from power generation library
    from idaes.power_generation.unit_models.boiler_heat_exchanger import (
        BoilerHeatExchanger, 
        TubeArrangement, 
        DeltaTMethod
    )
    import pyomo.environ as pyo
    # import methods to build the flowsheet and deactivate performance constraints
    import boiler_data_rec as flowsheet

2.2 Flowsheet Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The “boiler_flowsheet” method imports all the unit models in the boiler
heat exchanger network, builds the flowsheet, builds the flowsheet
connectivity, and initializes the flowsheet.

The final solve corresponds to a simulation case, with the following
inputs (relative to a ~650 MW case): - Econommizer (water): F, h, P -
Reheater Inlet (Cold Reheat steam): F, h, P - Coal flowrate (kg/s) and
stoichiometric ratio (unitless) - Dimensions of all units (tube
diameter, # tubes, hx area, etc.)

.. code:: ipython3

    # Create boiler flowsheet, the main unit models are: 
    # heat exchanger model: economizer, primary super heater, finishing superheater, and reheater
    # heater model: water wall and platen superheater
    
    m = flowsheet.boiler_flowsheet()

3. Simplify to Mass and Energy Balances
---------------------------------------

For data reconciliation, the flowsheet model should be reduced to mass
and energy balances and potentially limited performance constraints to
keep the results feasible.

.. code:: ipython3

    # Deactivate constraints for heat transfer (for all heat exchanger units)
    # for example to deactivate heat trasnfer calculation in the economizer we include:
    # m.fs.ECON.overall_heat_transfer_coefficient_eqn.deactivate()
    
    # The method "deactivate_performance_constraints" deactivates the equations for all 
    # heat exchangers in this flowsheet (Economizer, Primary Superheater, 
    #                                    Finishing Superheater, Reheater)
    flowsheet.deactivate_performance_constraints(m)
    
    # Now the model has 12 DoF 
    # deltaP shell and tube, and U - overall heat transfer coefficient in 4 hx models


.. parsed-literal::

    degrees of freedom = 12
    

4. Map Data to the Model
------------------------

Although the model mapping can be added to the tag metadata file, here
we just add the mapping information to the tag metadata after reading
the data.

.. code:: ipython3

    # Water/Steam Measurements ----------------------------------------------- #
    # Economizer inputs
    df_meta["BFW_F"]["reference_string"] = "m.fs.ECON.side_1.properties_in[:].flow_mol"
    df_meta["BFW_T"]["reference_string"] = "m.fs.ECON.side_1.properties_in[:].temperature"
    df_meta["BFW_P"]["reference_string"] = "m.fs.ECON.side_1.properties_in[:].pressure"
    
    # Economizer outputs
    df_meta["ECON_OUT_T"]["reference_string"] = "m.fs.ECON.side_1.properties_out[:].temperature"
    df_meta["ECON_OUT_P"]["reference_string"] = "m.fs.ECON.side_1.properties_out[:].pressure"
    
    # Reheater inputs 
    df_meta['RHT_COLD_T']["reference_string"] = "m.fs.RH.side_1.properties_in[:].temperature"
    df_meta['RHT_COLD_P']["reference_string"] = "m.fs.RH.side_1.properties_in[:].pressure"
    df_meta['RHT_COLD_F']["reference_string"] = "m.fs.RH.side_1.properties_in[:].flow_mol"
    
    # Reheater outputs 
    df_meta['RHT_HOT_T']["reference_string"] = "m.fs.RH.side_1.properties_out[:].temperature"

    # The output from the data reconciliation step usually gives full stream information

5. View Model Flowsheet
-----------------------

Model results or other quantities can be added to a process flow
diagram. The PFD was drawn beforehand and the model results are added to
tagged locations on the PFD.

.. code:: ipython3

    from idaes.core.util.misc import svg_tag  # utility to place numbers/text in an SVG
    
    with open("boiler_scpc_PFD.svg", "r") as f:
        s = svg_tag(svg=f, tags={"subtitle":"Initialized Model"})
        s = svg_tag(svg=s, tags=data_tags, outfile="boiler_scpc_init.svg")

.. code:: ipython3

    from IPython.display import SVG, display
    
    display(SVG(s))



.. image:: output_20_0.svg


6. Write Objective
------------------

Next we write the objective function and additional constraints for the
data reconciliation problem. The objective is

.. math:: \min \sum_i \left(\frac{x_{\text{data}, i} - x_{\text{model}, i}}{\sigma_i} \right)^2

Where :math:`i \in \{\text{Measured Quantities}\}` and :math:`\sigma_i`
is the standard deviation of measurement i estimated by binning the
data.

.. code:: ipython3

    # Add model parameters to contain measured data.  These are mutable so we can set a specific 
    # change to specific data points later.
    m.data = pyo.Param(data_tags, mutable=True, doc="Process data for a specific point in time.")
    m.data_stdev = pyo.Param(data_tags, mutable=True, doc="Process data standard deviation.")

.. code:: ipython3

    # The 'set_data' function below takes data from the model DataFrame and updates the
    # model data parameters.
    # fix tags dictionary is used to fix model inputs to their values in the data set (for each data point)
    # in this case Boiler Feed Water = inlet to economizer and Reheater Cold = Reheater inlet
    def set_data(m, df, data_tags, index=None, indexindex=None):
        if index is None:
            index = df.index[indexindex]
        m.bin_no = df.iloc[index]["bin_no"]
        for t in data_tags:
            m.data[t] = df.iloc[index][t]
            m.data_stdev[t] = bin_stdev[m.bin_no][t]

.. code:: ipython3

    # So we have something reasonable to start, set the data attached to the model to the first 
    # data point.
    set_data(m, df, data_tags, indexindex=0)

Add an expression for error divided by the standard deviation, and use
it to write the data reconciliation objective function.

.. code:: ipython3

    m.tags_obj = [
        'BFW_F', 
        'BFW_T', 
        'BFW_P',        
        "RHT_COLD_F", 
        "RHT_COLD_T", 
        "RHT_COLD_P",
        "ECON_OUT_T",
        "ECON_OUT_P",
        "RHT_HOT_T",
        "RHT_HOT_P",
        "MS_T", 
        "MS_P", 
        "FG_2_ECON_P",
        "FG_2_AIRPH_T",
        "FG_2_AIRPH_P",
        "FG_RH_2_Mix_T",
        "FG_RH_2_Mix_P",
        "FG_RH_2_Mix_Fm",
        "FG_2_FSH_P",
        "FG_2_FSH_T",
        "FG_PrSH_2_Mix_T",
        "FG_PrSH_2_Mix_P",
        "FG_PrSH_2_Mix_Fm",
    ]
    
    @m.Expression(data_tags)
    def err(m, i):
        return (m.data[i] - data_tags[i])/m.data_stdev[i]
    
    m.objective = pyo.Objective(expr=sum(m.err[t]**2 for t in m.tags_obj))

7. Solve Optimization
---------------------

Now we need to solve the data reconciliation problem for every data
point. The important results are stored in two DataFrames ``df_result``
which contains results tagged based on model stream names to be used in
the parameter estimation step and ``df_result_cmp`` which contains
reconciled data based on the original measurement tags and can be used
to compare the original measurements to the reconciled results.

.. code:: ipython3

    # Add constraints or fix variable bounds to ensure reasonable flowsheet performance (i.e. LMTD, negative pressure drop, etc.).
    # In this case, before solving the data reconciliation problem
    # unfix the coal flowarate, stoichiometric ratio, and split fraction (flue gas to Reheater)
    
    # Surrogate models have been trained using a rigorous boiler fire side model 
    # with fixed wall temperature and variable fuel flowrate and stoichiometric ratio.
    m.fs.coal_flow.unfix()
    m.fs.coal_flow.setub(70.0)
    m.fs.coal_flow.setlb(30.0)
    m.fs.SR.unfix() # stoichiometric ratio 
    m.fs.Spl1.split_fraction[0,'outlet_1'].unfix()
    
    # Surrogate models are used for Flue Gas Exit Temperature, flue gas component molar flowrate,
    # and heat duty to the platen superheater and water wall
    m.fs.FSH.side_2.properties_in[:].temperature.unfix()
    m.fs.FSH.side_2.properties_in[:].pressure.fix()
    m.fs.FSH.side_2.properties_in[0].temperature.setub(1800)
    m.fs.FSH.side_2.properties_in[0].temperature.setlb(1200)
    
    # unfix flowsheet inlets
    m.fs.ECON.side_1_inlet.unfix()
    m.fs.RH.side_1_inlet.unfix()

.. code:: ipython3

    solver = pyo.SolverFactory('ipopt')
    solver.options = {'tol': 1e-6,
                       'halt_on_ampl_error': 'no',
                       'max_iter': 250}

.. code:: ipython3

    import pandas as pd
    # add bin information to reconciliation results so it can be used in parameter estimation
    df_result = pd.DataFrame(columns=list(recon_tags.keys())+["termination", "bin_no", "bin_power"], index=df.index)
    df_result_cmp = pd.DataFrame(columns=list(data_tags.keys())+["termination"], index=df.index)
    
    for i in df.index:
        set_data(m, df, data_tags, index=i)
        try:
            res = solver.solve(m)
            tc = str(res.solver.termination_condition)
        except:
            tc = "fail"
        df_result.iloc[i]["termination"] = tc
        df_result.iloc[i]["bin_no"] = df.iloc[i]["bin_no"]
        df_result.iloc[i]["bin_power"] = df.iloc[i]["bin_power"]
        df_result_cmp.iloc[i]["termination"] = tc
        for t in recon_tags:
            df_result.iloc[i][t] = pyo.value(recon_tags[t])
        for t in data_tags:
            df_result_cmp.iloc[i][t] = pyo.value(data_tags[t])
        print(f"{i} -- {tc}, objective: {pyo.value(m.objective)}")
