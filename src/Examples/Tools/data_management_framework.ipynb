    "<br/> <br/>\n",
    "This tutorial will introduce you to the use of the IDAES Data Management Framework (DMF).\n",
    "The purpose of the DMF is to give IDAES users an easy and consistent way to manage the data they use and create, with a particular focus on (a) the ability to annotate all data items with a combination of pre-defined and user-defined metadata, and (b) the ability to link between data items to record relationships between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn:\n",
    "* Basic DMF terms and concepts\n",
    "* How to create a new DMF instance\n",
    "* How to add your data to the DMF\n",
    "* How to set up *relations* to show dependencies and provenance of resources\n",
    "* How to find, load, and remove data from the DMF\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conventions\n",
    "The typographic conventions used in this tutorial are as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Names of files will be in \"double quotes\", new terms will be in *italics*, and keywords and source code snippets will be in `fixed-width type`.\n",

    "## Basic concepts\n",
    "This section describes the DMF conceptually, introducing standard terms used in this context. The terms are summarized at the end of the section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workspaces\n",
    "The DMF is designed to support multiple users, or multiple different projects for the same user. Different users or projects are isolated from each other through the concept of a DMF *workspace*. Each DMF instance is initialized with a given workspace, and all its DMF operations are confined to that workspace. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the default (and only, at this time) storage engine, the a directory in the filesystem is used for each workspace.\n",
    "As long as file permissions allow it, multiple users can\n",
    "share the same workspace, but note that there is no authentication required to modify DMF contents, so users must\n",
    "take care to coordinate their actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "    &#9998; <b>Details:</b>\n",
    "    There is a global configuration stored in the user's home directory in a file called \".dmf\".<br/>\n",
    "    This file records, among other things, the 'current' workspace. This avoids having to specify the workspace\n",
    "    with every command from the command-line interface.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resources and relations\n",
    "The DMF is designed to store *resources*, which can be any sort of digital data, and to allow users to add structured metadata to describe the author, date, and origin of those resources. Users can explicitly register the *relations*, or named connections, between resources in the DMF, and use these to navigate between resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Files\n",
    "Usually, but not always, each resource will be associated with one or more files, such as a data file, an image, or\n",
    "a spreadsheet. These files are by default copied into the DMF's workspace at the time the resource is added. \n",
    "After this, the file may be changed or deleted without affecting the DMF.\n",
    "There is an option to instead refer to the location of the file (in the filesystem). This has the advantage of efficiency -- no data is copied -- and will also, for better or worse, let the file's contents change even as the resource ID stays the same. In this case, it is\n",
    "considered the user's problem to protect the file from being moved or deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terms\n",
    "- *resource*: Digital data, with attached metadata, that is managed by the DMF\n",
    "- *relation*: Connection between two resources, which has a named type. Connections are directional in their sense -- resource A \"derived from\" resource B -- but can be navigated in both the \"in\" and \"out\" direction.\n",
    "- *JSON*: Short for JavaScript Object Notation, this is a standard way to format structured data. See https://json.org for more information."
