    "The CO2, H2O mixture is commonly observed as a part of carbon capture systems with water rich solvents, as well as carbon storage systems. In order to simulate and optimize these systems, it is important to understand the thermodynamic properties and equilibrium behavior of this mixture. \n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this tutorial is as follows:\n",
    "1. Develop a property package for CO2, H2O system phase equilibrium, using the generic property package framework in IDAES, in a stepwise manner.\n",
    "2. Implement the property package for simulating a flash unit model, and study the VLE behavior \n",
    "\n",
    "The assumptions while building this property package is as follows:\n",
    "1. The vapor and liquid phases show ideal behavior\n",
    "2. CO2 is a non condensable, and its concentration is negligible in liquid phase\n",
    "3. The package would be applicable to systems at a pressure close to 1 atm \n",
