    "Following the previous example implementing a [Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) unit model](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/GitHub/examples-pse/src/Examples/UnitModels/Reactors/cstr_testing.ipynb), we can alter the flowsheet to use a stochiometric (or yield) reactor. As before, this example is adapted from Fogler, H.S., Elements of Chemical Reaction Engineering 5th ed., 2016, Prentice Hall,  p. 157-160 with the following chemical reaction, property packages and flowsheet. Unlike the previous two reactors which apply performance equations to calculate reaction extent, this simplified reactor model neglects all geometric properties and allows the user to specify a yield per reaction. The state variables chosen for the property package are **molar flows of each component by phase in each stream, temperature of each stream and pressure of each stream**. The components considered are: **ethylene oxide, water, sulfuric acid and ethylene glycol** and the process occurs in liquid phase only. Therefore, every stream has 4 flow variables, 1 temperature and 1 pressure variable.\n",
