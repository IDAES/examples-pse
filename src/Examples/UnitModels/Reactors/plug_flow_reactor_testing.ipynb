    "Following the previous example implementing a CSTR unit model, we can alter the flowsheet to use a plug flow reactor (PFR). As before, this example is adapted from Fogler, H.S., Elements of Chemical Reaction Engineering 5th ed., 2016, Prentice Hall,  p. 157-160 with the following chemical reaction, property packages and flowsheet. Unlike a CSTR which assumes well-mixed liquid behavior, the concentration profiles will vary spacially in one dimension. In actuality, following start-up flow reactor exhibit dynamic behavior as they approach a steady-state equilibrium; we will assume our system has already achieved steady-state behavior. The state variables chosen for the property package are **molar flows of each component by phase in each stream, temperature of each stream and pressure of each stream**. The components considered are: **ethylene oxide, water, sulfuric acid and ethylene glycol** and the process occurs in liquid phase only. Therefore, every stream has 4 flow variables, 1 temperature and 1 pressure variable.\n",

    "We do, however, need to specify each finite element via a first-order reaction performance equation. This can be done succintly by adding a rate_constant(m, x) method to which we pass the model and each spacial point. Note that our performance equation is a differential equation, and we must index our differentiable variable (conversion) by a continuous set (our length domain). The heat duty is not fixed, since the heat of reaction depends on the reactor conversion, and temperature effects are captured as well by our rate constant method. We'll estimate 80% conversion for our initial flowsheet:"
