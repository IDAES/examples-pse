    "Following the previous example implementing a [Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) unit model](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/GitHub/examples-pse/src/Examples/UnitModels/Reactors/cstr_testing.ipynb), we can alter the flowsheet to use a plug flow reactor (PFR). As before, this example is adapted from Fogler, H.S., Elements of Chemical Reaction Engineering 5th ed., 2016, Prentice Hall,  p. 157-160 with the following chemical reaction, property packages and flowsheet. Unlike a CSTR which assumes well-mixed liquid behavior, the concentration profiles will vary spatially in one dimension. In actuality, following start-up flow reactor exhibit dynamic behavior as they approach a steady-state equilibrium; we will assume our system has already achieved steady-state behavior. The state variables chosen for the property package are **molar flows of each component by phase in each stream, temperature of each stream and pressure of each stream**. The components considered are: **ethylene oxide, water, sulfuric acid and ethylene glycol** and the process occurs in liquid phase only. Therefore, every stream has 4 flow variables, 1 temperature and 1 pressure variable.\n",
