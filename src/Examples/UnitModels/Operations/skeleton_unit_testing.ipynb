    "This notebook demonstrates usage of the IDAES Skeleton Unit Model, which provides a generic \"bare bones\" unit for user-defined models and custom variable and constraint sets. To allow maximum versatility, this unit may be defined as a surrogate model or a custom equation-oriented model. Users must add ports and variables that match connected models, and this is facilitated through a provided method to add port-variable sets.\n",

    "# 1. Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, a specific application requires a unique unit operation that does not exist in the IDAES repository. Custom user models may source from external scripts, import surrogate equations or use first-principles calculations. However, IDAES flowsheets adhere to a standardized modeling hierarchy and simple Pyomo models do not always follow these conventions. Additionally, simple flowsheet submodels often require integration with other IDAES unit models which requires consistency between corresponding port variables, stream properties and physical unit sets, as well as proper usage of `ControlVolume` blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IDAES `SkeletonUnitModel` allows custom creation of user models blocks that do not require `ControlVolume` blocks, and enabling connection with standard IDAES unit models that do contain `ControlVolume` blocks. To motivate the usefulness and versatility of this tool, we will consider a simple pervaporation unit. The custom model does not require rigourous thermodynamic calculations contained in adjacent unit models, and using a Skeleton model allows definition of only required variables and constraints. The new block does require state variable connections for the inlet and outlet streams. We will demonstrate this scenario below to highlight the usage and benefits of the Skeleton model."

    "# 2. Example - Pervaporation\n",
    "\n",
    "Pervaporation is a low-energy separation process, and is particularly advantageous over distillation for azeotropic solutions or aqueous mixtures of heavy alcohols. Ethylene glycol is more environmentally friendly than typical chloride- and bromide-based dessicants, and is a common choice for commericial recovery of water from flue gas via liquid spray columns. Due to ethylene glycol's high boiling point, diffusion-based water recovery is economically favorable compared to distillation-based processes. The following example and flux correlation are taken from the literature source below:\n",

Feng, Dehydration of ethylene glycol by pervaporation using poly(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate)/polysulfone composite membranes, Separation and Purification Technology, Volume 64, Issue 1, 2008, Pages 63-70, ISSN 1383-5866, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2008.08.004.\n",

    "The diagram below is taken from the literature, showing an inlet aqueous glycol feed circulated through a feed tank-membrane-feed tank recycle loop while permeate is continuously extracted by the membrane. To demonstrate the usefulness of the Skeleton model, we will model this system as a Mixer and custom Pervaporation unit define the flux as an empirical custom mass balance term rather than requiring rigorous diffusion calculations. We will also circumvent the need for a vapor phase and VLE calculations by manually calculating the duty to condense and collect permeate vapor, and use correlations for steady-state fluxes to avoid a recycle requiring tear calculations.\n",

    "The IDAES Skeleton Unit Model is a powerful tool for implementing relatively simple first-princples, surrogate-based or empirical unit operations. More crucially, users can add their own custom models and integrate them into a larger IDAES flowsheet without adding control volumes or rigorous flow balance and equilibrium calculations when not required. The pervaporation example displays a case where all model equations are empirical correlations or simple manual calculations, with a small number of state variable and port connections, and the Skeleton model avoids complex calculations that impact model tractability. The example also demonstrates adding a custom initialization scheme to handle internally model degrees of freedom, a feature providing greater user control than with most IDAES unit models."
