    "\n",
    "Created by Prof. Alex Dowling (adowling@nd.edu) at the University of Notre Dame. This notebook (and Degeneracy Hunter) should be considered a \"beta\" prelease. This material was developed for the course CBE 40499/60499 at the University of Notre Dame (February - May, 2021). This notebook and Degeneracy Hunter will be refined during and after the semester into an official IDAES example. But for now, enjoy this new model diagnostic tool.\n",

    "* Inspect constraint violations and bounds of a Pyomo model\n",
    "* Compute the Irreducible Degenerate Set (IDS) for a Pyomo model\n",
    "* Demonstrates the Ipopt performance benefits from removing a single redundant constraint\n",
