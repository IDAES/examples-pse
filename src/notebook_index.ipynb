    "The IDAES examples are contained in Jupyter Notebooks. In order to view and use this content, you need to open the files with the Jupyter notebook executable (which may be configured on your system as the default application for files of this type). To get started with Jupyter, please see the [Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org) or jump directly to the [official Jupyter Notebook documentation pages](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).\n",
    "In addition to viewing and running the examples interactively on your own computer, you can see fully rendered, static versions of the examples in the online [examples documentation](https://IDAES.github.io/examples-pse/) pages.
